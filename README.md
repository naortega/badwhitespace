# BadWhiteSpace

If you're used to doing things on the terminal (like I am) then having spaces in
your files is extremely annoying. This script will take all the files or
directories passed as arguments to it and replace the spaces with underscores
(`_`).

## TODO

- Create a new argument that allows the user to set the replacement
  character(s).
